    "Particle motion under gravity and drag are useful test cases because they are quite simple.  However, there are only so many things that can occur because there is no interaction between different particles.  An interesting generalization of particle motion is the case in which we do not assume uniform gravity, but rather use the full specification for the gravitational force between two particles $i$ and $j$ (or more specifically, the force exerted on particle $i$ by particle $j$), which is given by\n",

Note that this force is anti-symmetric (in the sense that the force on particle $i$ exerted by particle $j$ is the negative of the force exerted on $j$ by $i$ - the only difference is that $r_{12}=-r_{21}$), and leads to an acceleration in particle $i$ due to its interaction with particle $j$ (and vice versa) that look like this\n",

    "### A conservative time stepping scheme\n",
    "Unfortunately these equations are a bit picky: they are sensitive to accumulating errors in the system.  One way to account for this is to use a time-stepping scheme that conserves energy exactly: even if the integration isn't accurate, it will not blow up.  One such algorithm is the Euler-Cromer algorithm, which is given by Eq. 3.34 in Gould.  **Implement this time-stepping scheme**.  Note in particular that Euler-Cromer is a bit more annoying to implement than, say, a Runge-Kutta method because the velocities must be treated differently (i.e. updated first) than the positions (which are updated using the *already updated* velocities).  As such, I suggest creating two lists of indices in the __init__ method that keep track of which entries in the state vector are velocities and which are positions.  "
