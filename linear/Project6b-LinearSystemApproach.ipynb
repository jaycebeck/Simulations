    "We have heretofore been approaching the discretization of spatial derivatives as a *convolution* operation, in which we slide a second derivative kernel over a function in order to get a function response.  An important fact is that convolution is a linear operation, which means that it's transitive and associative and all that, but stuff, but also that we can rewrite the convolution operation by a matrix.  To see this, recall that for some arbitrary location in the domain, we have as a right hand side\n",
